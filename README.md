## Background 
Cities used to rely on costly and time-consuming traditional methods - traffic studies, static monitoring and GPS tracking - to gain insights into road use and traffic patterns. However, these methods often didn't capture vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists. Vivacity offers data-driven solutions to overcome these limitations. Leveraging cutting-edge tech and advanced algorithms, their products provide real-time granular insights. Easily integrated with existing infrastructure, they offer a cost-efficient solution for cities to make more informed decisions about road safety, traffic management and urban planning - ultimately improving citizens' quality of life.
