# Vivacity-Lab:Business-model
The Vivacity Business Model repository is a collection of detailed information and analysis of the Smart Traffic Monitor product and its business model. It covers the product's value proposition, customer segments, revenue streams, key resources, activities, partnerships, cost structure, and sustainability/ethics/security/community considerations. 
## Overview/Executive Summary
vivacity-Lab  shows in their web that they are selling 3 products: 

Smart Traffic Monitoring
Smart Road Safety
Smart Signal Control: AI for Detection

all of them are based on the same sensor, but the software and the solution is different

## Background 
Cities used to rely on costly and time-consuming traditional methods - traffic studies, static monitoring and GPS tracking - to gain insights into road use and traffic patterns. However, these methods often didn't capture vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists. Vivacity offers data-driven solutions to overcome these limitations. Leveraging cutting-edge tech and advanced algorithms, their products provide real-time granular insights. Easily integrated with existing infrastructure, they offer a cost-efficient solution for cities to make more informed decisions about road safety, traffic management and urban planning - ultimately improving citizens' quality of life.

## Introduction
This report evaluates Vivacity-Lab's business model, based on the Business Model Canvas framework developed by Osterwalder and Pigneur. The Canvas consists of nine core components: customer segments, value proposition, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure. It will also discuss the company's ethical, sustainable, secure, and community-oriented approaches.
## Value Proposition
As part of the value propositions, newness, convenience, and accessibility, Vivacity's approach is cost-efficient and integrates with existing infrastructure, allowing cities to access the latest technology and data insights without replacing infrastructure. Easy access to real-time data is provided via a web-based dashboard, API downloads and third-party integrations. Vivacity also provides accessible solutions that improve road safety and ensure all citizens have equal access to road use, public transport and active travel benefits.
## Customer Segments

Vivacity's core customer relationship strategy offers its clients a dedicated personal assistant. This personalized approach involves assigning a customer representative to the client, allowing for a deep and intimate relationship to develop over time. The personal assistant is an approach that is more suitable to the type of vivacity especially because they have products with new abilities and require unique skills.  In addition, it is possible that Vivacity also provides automated services to its customers, although this information is  not  publicly available.

## Revenue Streams

Vivacity's revenue streams  are generated through the sale and rental of its hardware devices. These assets are used by local authorities and transportation agencies to gather real-time data insights on road users and traffic patterns, which are then used to inform road safety schemes and optimize traffic flow. Vivacity might  also generate revenue through ongoing maintenance and support services for its products. Additionally, they may offer data analytics services and software solutions to their clients, which can provide additional revenue streams.

## Key Resources
Based on the categories of Key Resources, Vivacity heavily relies on human resources, both physical and intellectual. The company's machine learning and computer vision technology require specialized skills and expertise, making human resources a critical component of its business model. In addition, Vivacity's physical resources, such as its sensors and hardware, are also important assets. However, the company's intellectual resources, including its proprietary algorithms and software, are equally crucial. Vivacity's intellectual property includes four registered patents and two registered trademarks. It is also important to note that according to Aberdeen, Vivacity Labs is projected to spend $32.5M on IT this year (Crunchbase, n.d.)
## Key Activities

## Key Partnerships
Vivacity collaborates with local councils and transportation authorities to provide intelligent transport systems. The company also partners with technology companies to support  and further develop its products and services. In addition, Vivacity might partner with companies that provide local signal controllers, such as Yunex, Swarco, and Telent, to integrate its sensors and data insights into existing traffic management systems. Research and academic institutions may also be potential partners for Vivacity, as they can provide access to the latest research and technology developments. 

Here it   will be a problem for the local signal controllers cause they are competitors (have to check or mention that in the reflection! )
