# Customer Segments

Vivacity's core customer relationship strategy offers its clients a dedicated personal assistant. This personalized approach involves assigning a customer representative to the client, allowing for a deep and intimate relationship to develop over time. The personal assistant is an approach that is more suitable to the type of vivacity especially because they have products with new abilities and require unique skills.  In addition, it is possible that Vivacity also provides automated services to its customers, although this information is  not  publicly available.

## Revenue Streams

Vivacity's revenue streams  are generated through the sale and rental of its hardware devices. These assets are used by local authorities and transportation agencies to gather real-time data insights on road users and traffic patterns, which are then used to inform road safety schemes and optimize traffic flow. Vivacity might  also generate revenue through ongoing maintenance and support services for its products. Additionally, they may offer data analytics services and software solutions to their clients, which can provide additional revenue streams(Dawood, 2021) (Vivacity Labs, 2022).

# Key Resources
Based on the categories of Key Resources, Vivacity heavily relies on human resources, both physical and intellectual. The company's machine learning and computer vision technology require specialized skills and expertise, making human resources a critical component of its business model. In addition, Vivacity's physical resources, such as its sensors and hardware, are also important assets. However, the company's intellectual resources, including its proprietary algorithms and software, are equally crucial. Vivacity's intellectual property includes four registered patents and two registered trademarks. It is also important to note that according to Aberdeen, Vivacity Labs is projected to spend $32.5M on IT this year (Crunchbase, n.d.)

# Key Activities
Vivacity invests in product development for their products, including software/hardware engineering, data analysis and algorithm development. To market the product, they create campaigns, attend industry events/conferences, and build relationships with potential customers/partners. Additionally, they provide ongoing maintenance/support, monitoring performance, resolving technical issues, and training/supporting customers(Dawood, 2021).

# Key Partnerships
Vivacity collaborates with local councils and transportation authorities to provide intelligent transport systems. The company also partners with technology companies such as Ford Mobility to support and further develop its products and services(Unknown, 2020). The company has worked with The Cross River Partnership (CRP) and  might partner with companies that provide local signal controllers, such as Yunex, Swarco, and Telent, to integrate its sensors and data insights into existing traffic management systems. Research and academic institutions may also be potential partners for Vivacity, as they can provide access to the latest research and technology developments (Al-qaness et al., 2021)(Mehmet, 2020). 


# Cost Structure
The value-driven approach of Vivacity's business model is reflected in its investment in research and development to improve its products and services. This includes hiring engineers and data scientists, developing algorithms, and refining the product to meet the needs of their target customer segments. Additionally, they allocate resources to marketing their products to transportation authorities and technology partners through activities such as campaign development, industry events and conferences, and relationship building. Vivacity recognizes the importance of ongoing maintenance and support for its products to ensure customer satisfaction, covering performance monitoring, technical resolution, and customer support/training. To maintain and expand their technology, they have overhead costs for storage, cloud computing, and other tech platforms. As a people-oriented business, human resources play a major role in its cost structure, offering competitive compensation packages to attract and retain employees. It can be seen that on the career page of Vivacity's website, they provide detailed information about their compensation packages for employees. This reflects the importance of human resources in their business model and their commitment to attracting and retaining top talent. These overhead costs, including office rent, utilities, insurance, and legal fees, are essential for everyday business and profitability (Vivacity, n.d.).

## Discussion and recommendation in perspective of Sustainability Ethics 

# Enhancing Vivacity's Value Proposition: The Benefits of Transparent Data Sharing and Collaboration for Urban Data Initiatives
Vivacity markets itself as a sensor company that focuses on monitoring road user behaviour, but its sensors are essentially cameras that process images on the edge and transmit data to their customers. In terms of privacy and ethics, Vivacity places a high priority on data protection and claims to only collect technical data that is anonymized (Unknown, 2021). However, there are concerns that individuals can be re-identified based on the data collected. To mitigate these risks, Vivacity blurs faces and only retains 10 minutes of video footage for calibration. They comply with GDPR and have implemented measures to ensure data security, although ongoing monitoring is recommended. VivaCity Limited also follows ethical values and maintains high standards of security and ethics through its Quality Management System. They emphasize continuous improvement and performance monitoring to protect customers' data and they provide clear and accessible information to the public about their data collection and use practices and how individuals can exercise their privacy rights. VivaCity's privacy notice explicitly states that they collect only anonymous traffic data, not personal data, although they may record short videos during development and testing. The captured data is processed by Vivacity and measures are in place to ensure its security. The company is registered with the ICO and has conducted Privacy Impact Assessments. They also inform the public about their sensors through temporary signage near the sensors before setup, calibration, or software training. (Vivacity, n.d.) (Lee, 2021).

By adopting a transparent and collaborative approach to data collection and analysis, as suggested by the Urban Data Collective, Vivacity could enable better decision-making and insights to improve urban service delivery and solve urban challenges. The data collected by Vivacity's sensors can provide valuable insights into traffic patterns, congestion, and road safety, which can be used to optimize transportation infrastructure, improve public safety, and reduce emissions. Moreover, investing in transparency and identifying opportunities for data sharing could enhance Vivacity's reputation and build trust among other organizations and stakeholders, fostering collaboration on urban data initiatives and improving cities and communities' outcomes. For instance, organizations like Swift could use Vivacity's data to develop more accurate and comprehensive mobility solutions in Queen Elizabeth Park, combining it with other urban data sources to optimize transportation services and reduce congestion. Furthermore, Vivacity's technology could be adapted to monitor the movement of wildlife and biodiversity surrounding the park, combined with the detection of various modes of transportation. By expanding its approach beyond road user behaviour, Vivacity could enhance its value proposition and contribute to broader urban data initiatives to improve cities' sustainability and livability.
