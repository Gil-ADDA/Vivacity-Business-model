Customers may pay for up-to-date data and understanding; however, their willingness to pay for rental of sensors, maintenance and software may vary.

Channels 
Vivacity connects with customers and partners through direct (in-house sales representatives) and indirect channels (key partners). It also leverages current customers to increase awareness, evaluate its value proposition, and facilitate purchases. Owned channels are favoured due to their higher margins, but partner channels are used to extend the reach and capitalize on partner strengths. Industry events and conferences, online marketing, social media, online demos, and webinars are used to promote, reach a broader audience, generate leads, and educate potential customers about their value proposition (Vivacity Labs, n.d.).

# Revenue Streams

Vivacity's revenue streams are generated through the sale and rental of its hardware devices. These assets, sensors, are used by local authorities and transportation agencies to gather real-time data insights on road users and traffic patterns, which are then used to inform road safety schemes and optimize traffic flow. Vivacity might also generate revenue through ongoing product maintenance and support services. Additionally, they may offer their clients data analytics services and software solutions, which can provide additional revenue streams(Dawood, 2021) (Vivacity Labs, 2022).

# Key Resources
Based on the categories of Key Resources, Vivacity heavily relies on human resources, both physical and intellectual. The company's machine learning and computer vision technology require specialized skills and expertise, making human resources a critical component of its business model. In addition, Vivacity's physical resources, such as its hardware, are also important assets. However, the company's intellectual resources, including its proprietary algorithms and software, are equally crucial. Vivacity's intellectual property includes four registered patents and two registered trademarks. It is also important to note that according to Aberdeen, Vivacity-Labs is projected to spend $32.5M on IT this year (Crunchbase, n.d.)

## Discussion and recommendation in perspective of Sustainability Ethics 

# Enhancing Vivacity's Value Proposition: The Benefits of Transparent Data Sharing and Collaboration for Urban Data Initiatives

Vivacity markets itself as a sensor company that focuses on monitoring road user behaviour, but its sensors are essentially cameras that process images on the edge and transmit data to their customers. In terms of privacy and ethics, Vivacity places a high priority on data protection and claims to only collect technical data that is anonymized (Unknown, 2021). However, there are concerns that individuals can be re-identified based on the data collected. To mitigate these risks, Vivacity blurs faces and only retains 10 minutes of video footage for calibration. They comply with GDPR and have implemented measures to ensure data security, although ongoing monitoring is recommended. VivaCity Limited also follows ethical values and maintains high standards of security and ethics through its Quality Management System. They emphasize continuous improvement and performance monitoring to protect customers' data and they provide clear and accessible information to the public about their data collection and use practices and how individuals can exercise their privacy rights. VivaCity's privacy notice explicitly states that they collect only anonymous traffic data, not personal data, although they may record short videos during development and testing. The captured data is processed by Vivacity and measures are in place to ensure its security. The company is registered with the ICO and has conducted Privacy Impact Assessments. They also inform the public about their sensors through temporary signage near the sensors before setup, calibration, or software training. (Vivacity, n.d.) (Lee, 2021).

By adopting a transparent and collaborative approach to data collection and analysis, as suggested by the Urban Data Collective, Vivacity could enable better decision-making and insights to improve urban service delivery and solve urban challenges. The data collected by Vivacity's sensors can provide valuable insights into traffic patterns, congestion, and road safety, which can be used to optimize transportation infrastructure, improve public safety, and reduce emissions. Moreover, investing in transparency and identifying opportunities for data sharing could enhance Vivacity's reputation and build trust among other organizations and stakeholders, fostering collaboration on urban data initiatives and improving cities and communities' outcomes. For instance, organizations like Swift could use Vivacity's data to develop more accurate and comprehensive mobility solutions in Queen Elizabeth Park, combining it with other urban data sources to optimize transportation services and reduce congestion. Furthermore, Vivacity's technology could be adapted to monitor the movement of wildlife and biodiversity surrounding the park, combined with the detection of various modes of transportation. By expanding its approach beyond road user behaviour, Vivacity could enhance its value proposition and contribute to broader urban data initiatives to improve cities' sustainability and livability(Kilkenny, 2023)(Gallacher, 2023).
