## Background 
Cities used to rely on costly and time-consuming traditional methods - traffic studies, static monitoring and GPS tracking - to gain insights into road use and traffic patterns. However, these methods often didn't capture vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists. Vivacity offers data-driven solutions to overcome these limitations. Leveraging cutting-edge tech and advanced algorithms, their products provide real-time granular insights. Easily integrated with existing infrastructure, they offer a cost-efficient solution for cities to make more informed decisions about road safety, traffic management and urban planning - ultimately improving citizens' quality of life.

## Introduction
This report evaluates Vivacity-Lab's business model, based on the Business Model Canvas framework developed by Osterwalder and Pigneur. The Canvas consists of nine core components: customer segments, value proposition, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure. It will also discuss the company's ethical, sustainable, secure, and community-oriented approaches.
## Value Proposition
As part of the value propositions, newness, convenience, and accessibility, Vivacity's approach is cost-efficient and integrates with existing infrastructure, allowing cities to access the latest technology and data insights without replacing infrastructure. Easy access to real-time data is provided via a web-based dashboard, API downloads and third-party integrations. Vivacity also provides accessible solutions that improve road safety and ensure all citizens have equal access to road use, public transport and active travel benefits.
## Customer Segments

Vivacity's core customer relationship strategy offers its clients a dedicated personal assistant. This personalized approach involves assigning a customer representative to the client, allowing for a deep and intimate relationship to develop over time. The personal assistant is an approach that is more suitable to the type of vivacity especially because they have products with new abilities and require unique skills.  In addition, it is possible that Vivacity also provides automated services to its customers, although this information is  not  publicly available.

## Revenue Streams

Vivacity's revenue streams  are generated through the sale and rental of its hardware devices. These assets are used by local authorities and transportation agencies to gather real-time data insights on road users and traffic patterns, which are then used to inform road safety schemes and optimize traffic flow. Vivacity might  also generate revenue through ongoing maintenance and support services for its products. Additionally, they may offer data analytics services and software solutions to their clients, which can provide additional revenue streams.

## Key Resources
Based on the categories of Key Resources, Vivacity heavily relies on human resources, both physical and intellectual. The company's machine learning and computer vision technology require specialized skills and expertise, making human resources a critical component of its business model. In addition, Vivacity's physical resources, such as its sensors and hardware, are also important assets. However, the company's intellectual resources, including its proprietary algorithms and software, are equally crucial. Overall, Vivacity's essential resources include physical and intellectual assets, with human resources playing a critical role. (## not finished yet )
